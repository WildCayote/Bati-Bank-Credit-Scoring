# Bati-Bank-Credit-Scoring

## Overview

Bati Bank, a leading financial service provider, is collaborating with an emerging eCommerce platform to introduce a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service. This service aims to provide customers with the convenience of purchasing products on credit, provided they qualify based on their creditworthiness. 

As an Analytics Engineer at Bati Bank, you have been tasked with developing a Credit Scoring Model to assess the risk of potential borrowers. This model will estimate the likelihood of default based on historical data and various financial metrics provided by the eCommerce platform. A robust and reliable credit scoring system will be key to ensuring Bati Bank can extend credit safely and efficiently while minimizing the risk of defaults.

The project will involve defining risk categories, selecting relevant predictive features, and developing models that estimate both the probability of default and the appropriate loan amount and duration for new customers.

## Key Objectives

1. Establish a proxy variable to classify users as high-risk (bad) or low-risk (good) borrowers based on their likelihood of defaulting.

2. Identify observable features from the dataset that have a strong correlation with the default variable, ensuring the chosen features are reliable predictors of creditworthiness.

3. Build a model that assigns a risk probability to new customers based on historical data, helping to assess their potential to default.

4. Develop a credit score model that translates risk probabilities into a credit score, allowing for a more interpretable creditworthiness assessment.

5. Create a model that predicts the optimal loan amount and duration, balancing customer needs with the bankâ€™s risk exposure.
